In terms for future expansions, the most critical would be testing an expanded neural network in order to see if the behaviour becomes more complex. The next step after that would be introduce a line of sight in order to restrict both agents to incomplete information of the game state, along with introducing multiple agents from both types into the simulation to observe if any teamwork behaviours evolve.

Further expansions to the system could include removing the chase ability of the predator in order to reduce the network complexity. A border around the board to indicate the edge of the board, or terrain modifications could be added. In addition, multiple board sizes could also be tested. Additional game rule variations should also be considered.
