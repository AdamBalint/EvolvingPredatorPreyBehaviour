\section{Introduction}

This thesis focuses on the competitive co-evolution of neural controllers with the hopes of evolving complex behaviour in the game of predator vs prey. Played on a board sized 9x9, the agents move simultaneously in hopes that the predator captures the prey while the prey attempts to avoid the predator. To encourage evolution within the system, walled and non-walled boards were tried along with three different variations in game rules. These game rules were adapted as the system was tested in order to counteract undesirable developments in previous versions of the game, or to encourage certain behaviours in the new version. To much surprise, the prey always emerged victorious by developing some interesting strategies. Some of these strategies involved running off the board in a walled off game, exploiting the game rules in their favour, or adapting to the predator tactics in order to emerge victorious. When facing these advanced prey, the predators did not stand much of a chance, as such further system improvements are suggested in order to even the playing field.
