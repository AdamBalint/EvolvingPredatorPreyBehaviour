\section{Results}

The results section will explain the results that were obtained using the parameter sets and will demonstrate any evolved behaviour. The walled game encompasses all of the experiments in Table \ref{tab:experiment-labels-1} using the rules in Table \ref{tab:game-rules} on a walled off board. The Game V1, V2 and V3 sections will discuss all of the experiments on a board where the agent can fall off using the corresponding V1, V2, and V3 rules.
