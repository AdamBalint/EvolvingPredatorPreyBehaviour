\subsection{Game V2}
Game V2 is the game with the even set of rules for the predators and the prey. This game mode should be the mode that provides the closest set of results between the predators and the prey. Unfortunately, the system still seems to provide an advantage to the prey as in every experiment the prey are the creatures with the highest fitness. However, unlike in the walled off game and the V1 game, in this game mode, there are times when the predators have a better score than the prey. Unfortunately for the prey, they always get outperformed by the prey.
