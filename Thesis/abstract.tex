This thesis examines the emerged behaviour with PSO trained neural controllers for the problem of predator vs prey. Variations of game rules were tried in order to encourage development of the creatures. This included variations such as the agents being able to fall off the board, and various scoring systems for the outcome of the game. Although initially some promising simplistic behaviour was seen, as the game rules were developed some more complex and surprising behaviour emerged.
