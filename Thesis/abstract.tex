This thesis examines the emerged behaviour with PSO trained neural controllers for the problem of predator vs prey. Variations of game rules were tried in order to counteract undesirable traits encourage development of the creatures. This included variations such as the agents being able to fall off the board, and various scoring systems for the outcome of the game. Although initially some promising simplistic behaviour was seen, and as the game rules were developed some more complex and surprising behaviour emerged. The prey always emerged victorious with some clever tactics being evolved to outsmart the predators and take advantage of the game rules.
